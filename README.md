Game engine for Island Adventure Game I am making.

Once my game is complete I will include a download link to my game.

Following completion of my game, I will start building out the engine itself
and include instructions of how to use it. It will be a basic engine, but 
good for anyone wanting to do a tile based game, and does not want to pay for an expensive
engine or learn one of the bigger engines like Unity, Unreal, or Godot.

Engine can be modified, copied, and distributed for non-commercial projects.
