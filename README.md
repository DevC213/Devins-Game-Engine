Game engine for Island Adventure Game I am making.

Once my game is complete I will include a download link to my game.

Following completion of my game, I will start building out the engine itself
and include instructions of how to use it. It will be a basic engine, but 
good for anyone wanting to do a simple JRPG, and not have to pay for an expensive
engine.

Cannont use for commercial use without my explicit permission.
